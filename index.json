[{"content":"What is a Window Manager ? A window manager, as its name implies manages the windows on your destkop. It controls things like the placement and appearance of your windows. It also controls things like tiling and floating of window.\nWhat is a tiling or floating window manager ? A floating window manager is generally what everyone uses, it is used in almost all desktop environments. The windows literally float on the screen and one can drag them anywhere.\nIn a tiling window manager, the windows are tiled, the edges line up perfectly. A tiling window manager automatically tiles windows for you in a particular layout. Many tiling window managers provide the user with multiple layout, some even provide manual tiling where the user can select each time where he wants the new window to tile. The former are called auto tilers and the later are called Manual tilers.\nWhat is Awesome WM ? Awesome wm is a tiling window manager that is configured in the lua programming language. This means that if you know even a little bit of lua ( even if you don\u0026rsquo;t you can use the well written documentaion) you can confgure it as you like. One can even make a desktop that if best suited for them if they are willing to spend the time in it. If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to configure things yourself, you can search online and just copy other peoples configuration and past it in yours.\nSome examples from unixporn ( a great place for people to post their own unix setups and find other\u0026rsquo;s):\n  [Awesome WM] (D)Arch Side of The Moon by ( by u/ofoxtrot)\nLink\n   [awesome wm] Basquiat ( by u/actionless)\nLink\n   [Awesome-Wm] military style v2\nLink\n  Awesome WM is mainly a tiling window manager but it also has a floating layout where all windows are floating windows. It has many layouts ( basically how the windows are going to be tiled ) and you can enable/disable any of them and even switch between different layouts anytime.\nThe one good thing about awesome wm is that it comes with a sensible default configuration that in itself can be a daily driver for many people. This makes getting started with configuring it easier than most other tiling window managers which don\u0026rsquo;t offer a good enough starting configuration if one at all.\nIt has many other cool features and it is better left for you to explore them yourselves.\nHow to get started with Awesoem WM ? Getting started with Awesome WM is easy, you just go to your terminal and install the awesome wm package from your package manager:\nArch Linux: sudo pacman -S awesome\nUbuntu: sudo apt install awesome\nDebian: sudo apt-get install awesome\nFedora: sudo dnf install awesome\nOpenSUSE: sudo zypper install awesome\nNow when you select the Awesome WM during login and then login, you should see something like this:\nThis is the default configuration. After this to start configuring Awesome WM, we need to first make the local configuration directory:\nmkdir -p ~/.config/awesome/\nThen you can either just copy someone\u0026rsquo;s configuration into this directory if you have or you can start with copying the default configuration and start modifying that.\nTo copy the default configuration:\ncp /etc/xdg/awesome/rc.lua ~/.config/awesome/\nTo copy the default theme, first make the themes directory:\nmkdir ~/.config/awesome/themes/\nthen copy over the themes:\ncp /usr/share/awesome/themes/ .config/awesome/themes/\nAfter this you can refer to the Awesome WM documentation which also has tutorials for beginners here.\nHACK AWAY!!!\n","permalink":"/posts/awesome-wm/","summary":"What is a Window Manager ?
