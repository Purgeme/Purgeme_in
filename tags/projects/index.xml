      <description>Paint is bloated The MS Paint application is bloated and so I needed something better, something simpler, something less &amp;ldquo;bloated&amp;rdquo; and so I set out on a quest to make my own &amp;ldquo;unbloated&amp;rdquo; paint application from scratch.
Just kidding it was a college project that I completed with my team.
Basically it is a paint application written in c++ and uses OpenGL.
Features  You can draw ( I thought this is pretty important ).</description>
