      <description>Paint is bloated The MS Paint application is bloated and so I needed something better, something simpler, something less &amp;ldquo;bloated&amp;rdquo; and so I set out on a quest to make my own &amp;ldquo;unbloated&amp;rdquo; paint application from scratch.
Not really, this is something I worked on with 2 friends for a college semester project.
Basically it is a paint application written in c++ and uses OpenGL.
For now it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have anything worth calling a feature, it is a paint application and it does that pretty well.</description>
